## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the specifications for MedEcon, a web-based tool for conducting cost-effectiveness analyses of medical treatments. The platform aims to help healthcare stakeholders evaluate both clinical efficacy and economic impact of emerging medical treatments, enabling evidence-based decision making.

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focuses on core functionality for analyzing individual treatments against standard comparators, with plans for more advanced features in future iterations.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Healthcare stakeholders face challenges when evaluating new treatments:
- Clinical efficacy data is often disconnected from economic impact assessment
- Cost-effectiveness analyses are complex and time-consuming
- Specialized expertise is required to interpret results
- Visualization tools for communicating findings are limited

### 2.2 Solution Approach

MedEcon addresses these challenges by providing:
- An integrated platform combining clinical and economic data
- User-friendly interface requiring minimal specialized knowledge
- Automated calculations and threshold-based recommendations
- Interactive visualizations and exportable reports

### 2.3 Target Users

| User Group | Description | Primary Needs |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Healthcare Providers | Hospital administrators, clinical directors, P&T committees | Treatment procurement decisions, resource allocation |
| Payers | Insurance companies, government agencies, MCOs | Coverage policies, reimbursement rates |
| Manufacturers | Pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, biotech firms | Value demonstration, pricing strategies |
| Researchers | Health economists, academic researchers, policy analysts | Comparative analyses, publication support |

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Architecture

The MVP will use a client-side architecture:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 with Bootstrap for responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for logic
- Chart.js for data visualization

Future versions may incorporate:
- Backend server (Node.js/Express)
- Database (MongoDB)
- Authentication system
- API integrations

### 4.2 Data Model

#### 4.2.1 Treatment Analysis

```javascript
{
  id: String,                    // Unique identifier
  name: String,                  // Treatment name
  comparator: String,            // Comparator treatment
  
  // Clinical parameters
  qalyGain: Number,              // QALY gain (vs comparator)
  successRate: Number,           // % success rate
  adverseEventRate: Number,      // % adverse event rate
  treatmentDuration: Number,     // Duration in months
  
  // Economic parameters
  treatmentCost: Number,         // Direct treatment cost
  administrationCost: Number,    // Administration cost
  monitoringCost: Number,        // Monitoring cost
  adverseEventCost: Number,      // Cost per adverse event
  
  // Results
  incrementalCost: Number,       // Calculated incremental cost
  icer: Number,                  // Calculated ICER
  recommendation: String,        // Cost-effectiveness recommendation
  
  // Metadata
  createdAt: Date,               // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date                // Last update timestamp
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Thresholds

```javascript
{
  highlyEffective: Number,       // Threshold for highly cost-effective ($/QALY)
  potentiallyEffective: Number   // Threshold for potentially cost-effective ($/QALY)
}
```

### 4.3 Key Algorithms

#### 4.3.1 ICER Calculation

```
// Calculate total costs for new treatment
totalCostNew = treatmentCost + administrationCost + monitoringCost + (adverseEventCost * adverseEventRate / 100)

// Comparator cost is either provided or assumed
totalCostComparator = comparatorCost

// Calculate incremental cost
incrementalCost = totalCostNew - totalCostComparator

// Calculate ICER
icer = incrementalCost / qalyGain
```

#### 4.3.2 Sensitivity Analysis

The sensitivity analysis varies key parameters by percentage increments (e.g., 70% to 130% of base case) to evaluate the impact on ICER.
